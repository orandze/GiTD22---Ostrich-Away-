This is a game I made for the GiTD contest #22 on Kongregate.com.
If you are reading this, you are probably here to help me figure out some bugs :)

First and foremost, there is a bug that wipes all saved data unexpectedly.
I have been able to recreate this by simply bying an upgrade and clicking "Play Again."
After playing for a few seconds, the upgrade screen will pop up again, and everything
will have been wiped clean.

Secondly, I'm having some issues with the offsets of the hitboxes on the enemies. This is because
They've all been scaled down to 0.5 on the x and y. I haven't played around too much
with hitboxes in the past so I'm not exactly sure how to adjust this.

Those are my main concerns for now. My brain's pretty wiped from the programming spree this
weekend. I shall continue work over the next few days, though.

If you discover anything else that needs to be addressed or if you have a solution for something,
I implore you to please message me on Kong at http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/orandze.

Thanks for your time!
